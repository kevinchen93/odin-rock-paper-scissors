# Rock Paper Scissors Project

This purpose of this project was to rebuild the classic rock-paper-scissors game and play against the computer.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).


## Pre-Project Thoughts

Note: At this point I only have basic HTML, CSS, Chrome Dev Tools, and Git skills.
I will do my best!

## Post-Project Thoughts

One thing the page is definitely missing is a more appealing landing page.
I will learn that later on in the curriculum.

Skills I demonstrated or strengthened at project end:   
-HTML <br>
-CSS <br>
-JavaScript <br>
-Writing readable code <br>
-Use of Chrome Developer Tools <br>
-Manipulating HTML elements through the use of the Document Object Model (DOM) <br>
-Use of `if...else` statements <br>
-Use of event handlers such as `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` <br>
